    <h2 onclick="toggleText('book2')">Chapter 2: Sold on Spring Break</h2>
    <p id="book2">I throw my hair in a messy bun and throw my new Panic! Shirt I got last week during a Hot Topic run with my best friend Luke. I make my way to the bathroom in the hall and sloppily do my eyeliner. Its crooked but I don’t care. After spraying some cucumber melon bath and body works, I make my way down the stairs hearing some voices coming from the living room. Odd. It’s 7AM on a school day not even my alcoholic mother would be here.</p>

    <h2 onclick="toggleText('book4')">Chapter 4: Where is she?</h2>
    <p id="book4">Luke storms up the front porch in a frenzy and starts beating on the screen door “Y/N Y/N Y/N Y/N Y/N Y/N” After what seems like hours to him but what actually been only five minutes the front door finally opens revealing Y/N’s mom. Luke looks at her distraught and speaks hastily “Where is she? Where is Y/N?” Y/N’s mom looks at him with disdain and lights the cigarette in her hand before speaking “Who?” “What do you mean WHO??? Your daughter! Y/N” Taking a drag of her cigarette her responses “I don’t have a daughter” Before Luke can say another word the door is slammed causing the screen door to open slightly hitting him in the face. </p>
